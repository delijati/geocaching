# Geocaching for Ubuntu Touch

An app for using geocaching.com(unofficial) on Ubuntu Touch, designed to be similar to [c:geo for Android](https://github.com/cgeo/cgeo).

This is a community maintained project that I do in my free time. While all efforts are taken to test everything works, in some cases things get overlooked. If you spot a problem please try to fix it and contribute where you can. If you aren't able to fix the issue, please file a bug under issues so we can track the progress and resolution of the problem.
